:blue[_GetAround is a car-sharing service that allows you to rent cars from people nearby. It's like the Airbnb of cars.
            When renting a car, users have to complete checkin flow at the beginning of the rental and a checkout flow at the end of the rental.
            The checkin and checkout can be done with distinct flows like the mobile app, connected car or paper form._]

            When using GetAround, drivers book a car for a specific period, from an hour to a few days long.
            They are suppose to bring back the car on time but it happens that they are late.
        Late returns are a problem for GetAround because it can impact the next driver who booked the car and also the car owner.]
